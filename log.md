### Day 4: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started Free Code Camp's calculator. +, -, *, /, and AC are working.

**Thoughts:** Starting a new project is always overwhelming. Writing pseudocode of all the steps I think I'll need helps breaking down the project.

### Day 5: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued on Free Code Camp's calculator. CE button is working. Able to do operations with decimals. Able to chain operations, ie 1+5/2. Cleaned up the code a little bit.

**Thoughts:** I'm starting to comment my thoughts at the beginning of the file. It's easier to remember.

### Day 6: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued on Free Code Camp's calculator. Styled the background and layout of the buttons.
