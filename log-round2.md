# 100 Days Of Code - Log round 2

### Day 1: August 28, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Studying Data Structure and Algorithm on the side. Implemented recursive fibonacci and factorial.  

**Thoughts:** This will keep me accountable again.

**Link to work:**

[Factorial](https://github.com/valeriaoshiro/DataStructure-Algorithms/blob/master/recursion/factorial.js)

[Fibonacci](https://github.com/valeriaoshiro/DataStructure-Algorithms/blob/master/recursion/fibonacci.js)

### Day 2: August 29, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continue on Lagos. Need to practice recursion gcd -_-    

**Thoughts:** Recursion is tough

[Flatten](https://github.com/valeriaoshiro/DataStructure-Algorithms/blob/master/recursion/flatten.js)

[GreatestCommonDivisor - not done](https://github.com/valeriaoshiro/DataStructure-Algorithms/blob/master/recursion/greatestCommonDivisor.js)
